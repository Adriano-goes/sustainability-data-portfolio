# Project — Energy & CO₂ Intensity (Europe)

# Goal
Build a simple, reproducible data pipeline to analyze energy consumption and CO₂ intensity across countries and visualize environmental performance trends.

# Objectives
Structure a professional data-science project for sustainability.
Explore country-level differences in energy intensity (kWh/m²) and CO₂ emissions (kg CO₂/m²).
Visualize the relationship between climate (HDD/CDD) and energy use.

# Key Insights
From the sample dataset:

# Highest energy intensity: Sweden (~180 kWh/m²) due to colder climate (HDD ≈ 3800).
Lowest CO₂ intensity: Sweden (~5 kg CO₂/m²) thanks to its clean electricity mix.
Highest CO₂ intensity: Germany (~48 kg CO₂/m²) — higher grid emission factor.
Takeaway: Energy efficiency alone isn’t enough — grid decarbonization matters just as much.

# Tech stack
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) — Data processing and visualization
JupyterLab — Interactive exploration
Anaconda — Environment and dependency management
Git & GitHub — Version control and publication

# Visuals
Example output generated by the notebook:

| Energy Intensity | CO₂ Intensity | | Energy Chart | CO₂ Chart |

# Next Steps

Add real datasets (e.g., Eurostat, IEA, CRREM, GHG Protocol).
Normalize per building type and occupancy.
Automate data refresh and generate PowerBI or Streamlit dashboards.
