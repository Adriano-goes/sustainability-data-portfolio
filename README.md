# Project — Energy & CO₂ Intensity (Europe)

# Goal
Build a simple, reproducible data pipeline to analyze energy consumption and CO₂ intensity across countries and visualize environmental performance trends.

# Objectives
- Structure a professional data-science project for sustainability.  
- Explore country-level differences in **energy intensity (kWh/m²)** and **CO₂ emissions (kg CO₂/m²)**.  
- Visualize the relationship between **climate (HDD/CDD)** and energy use.

# Key Insights

From the sample dataset:

- **Highest energy intensity:** Sweden (~180 kWh/m²) due to colder climate (HDD ≈ 3800).  
- **Lowest CO₂ intensity:** Sweden (~5 kg CO₂/m²) thanks to its clean electricity mix.  
- **Highest CO₂ intensity:** Germany (~48 kg CO₂/m²) — higher grid emission factor.  
- **Takeaway:** Energy efficiency alone isn’t enough — *grid decarbonization* matters just as much.

# Next Steps
- Add real datasets (e.g., Eurostat, IEA, CRREM, GHG Protocol).  
- Normalize per building type and occupancy.  
- Automate data refresh and generate PowerBI or Streamlit dashboards.
