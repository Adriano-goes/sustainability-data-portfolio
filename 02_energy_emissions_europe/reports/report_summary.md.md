## 🌍 Insights from Example Dataset

- **Highest energy intensity:** Sweden (≈ 180 kWh/m²) — colder climate and high heating needs (HDD ≈ 3800).  
- **Lowest CO₂ intensity:** Sweden again (≈ 5 kg CO₂/m²) — due to its very clean electricity mix (only 30 g CO₂/kWh).  
- **Highest CO₂ intensity:** Germany (≈ 48 kg CO₂/m²) — both high energy use and higher grid emissions.  
- **Climate effect:** Countries with higher Heating Degree Days tend to consume more energy, but CO₂ depends on the electricity mix, not just consumption.

This shows why **energy efficiency** and **decarbonized grids** must progress together for real emissions reductions.
